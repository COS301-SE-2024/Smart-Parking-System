# Smart Parking System Functional Requirement 

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Requirements
1. **Real-Time Slot Availability**
    - The system must accurately track and display the availability of parking slots in real-time.

2. **User-Friendly Interface**
    - An intuitive web interface should allow users to:
        - Check parking availability.
        - Reserve parking spots.
        - Receive notifications.

3. **Security Measures**
    - Ensure data privacy and secure communication channels.
    - Implement user authentication mechanisms.

#### Optional Requirements
1. **Mobile Application**
    - Develop a mobile app to extend system access on mobile platforms.

2. **Payment Integration**
    - Allow users to pay for parking directly through the app.

3. **Predictive Analytics**
    - Utilize historical data to predict peak parking times and optimize resource allocation.

4. **Parking Lot Navigation**
    - Provide turn-by-turn directions to available parking slots within the facility.

5. **Reservation Reminders**
    - Send notifications to users before their reserved time slots.

6. **Parking Violation Alerts**
    - Detect unauthorized parking and notify the relevant authorities.

7. **Integration with Smart City Initiatives**
    - Collaborate with other smart systems (e.g., traffic management, public transportation) to provide a holistic urban experience.

#### Wow Factors
1. **Predictive Parking Availability**
    - Implement machine learning algorithms to predict parking availability based on historical data, events, and time of day.
    - Provide users with real-time forecasts to help them plan their arrival.

2. **Dynamic Pricing and Incentives**
    - Implement demand-based pricing: higher rates during peak hours and lower rates during off-peak times.
    - Offer discounts or loyalty points for consistent use of the system.

3. **License Plate Recognition**
    - Integrate License Plate Recognition (LPR) cameras to automate entry and exit.
    - Enable touchless access for registered users to reduce manual ticketing.

4. **Parking Space Navigation**
    - Provide turn-by-turn directions within the parking facility.
    - Guide users to available spots efficiently to minimize search time.

#### Design Requirements
1. **Frameworks and Technologies**
    - Choose suitable frameworks for web and mobile interfaces (e.g., Angular, React, React Native, Flutter).
    - Ensure cross-platform compatibility and responsive design for various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

2. **User Experience (UX)**
    - Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for parking spot availability, reservation, and payment.
    - Implement clear visual cues (colors, icons) to indicate slot status (available, reserved, occupied).
    - Optimize user flows for booking, navigation, and payment.

3. **Accessibility**
    - Design with accessibility in mind (e.g., screen readers, keyboard navigation).
    - Provide alternative text for images and clear labels for form fields.

#### Constraints
1. **Privacy and Security**
    - Protect user data captured by cameras by implementing encryption and complying with data protection regulations.
    - Inform users about camera surveillance and obtain necessary consent.
    - Balance security measures with privacy rights.

2. **Data Sets**
    - Utilize relevant datasets for training and improving the system:
