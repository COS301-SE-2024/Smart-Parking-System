# Architectural Requirements

### Quality Requirements

#### 1. Performance
- **Response Time**: The system must provide real-time updates on parking slot availability within 2 seconds.
- **Throughput**: The system should handle at least 1000 concurrent user requests without performance degradation.

#### 2. Reliability
- **Uptime**: Ensure 99.9% system availability, equating to a maximum of 8.77 hours of downtime per year.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Implement redundancy to maintain functionality during hardware or software failures.

#### 3. Scalability
- **User Capacity**: The system should scale to support a growing number of users and parking lots without performance loss.
- **Data Handling**: Efficiently manage and process large volumes of data from various parking sensors and user interactions.

#### 4. Security
- **Data Protection**: Employ end-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest to protect user information.
- **Access Control**: Implement robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) and ensure user privacy is maintained.

#### 5. Usability
- **User Interface**: Provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface with clear visual cues for parking status (available, reserved, occupied).
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the system is accessible to users with disabilities, including support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Feedback**: Offer prompt and informative feedback for user actions (e.g., booking confirmation, error messages).

#### 6. Maintainability
- **Code Quality**: Write clean, well-documented, and modular code to facilitate easy maintenance and updates.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement comprehensive monitoring and logging to detect and diagnose issues promptly.
- **Updatability**: Design the system to accommodate future enhancements and technology upgrades with minimal disruption.

#### 7. Portability
- **Platform Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility across multiple platforms (web, iOS, Android) with responsive design for various device types.
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Support deployment on various cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and on-premises environments if necessary.

#### 8. Efficiency
- **Resource Utilization**: Optimize the system for efficient use of resources (e.g., CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
- **Energy Consumption**: Minimize energy consumption, particularly for IoT devices and sensors, to extend battery life and reduce operational costs.

#### 9. Testability
- **Automated Testing**: Implement automated testing for critical system components to ensure reliability and performance.
- **Coverage**: Achieve high test coverage for both unit tests and integration tests to validate functionality under various conditions.
- **User Testing**: Conduct usability testing with real users to gather feedback and improve the user experience.
